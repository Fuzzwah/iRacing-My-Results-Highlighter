# iRacing-My-Results-Highlighter
Highlights the rows of your entries in the iRacing event results table.

You can edit the drivers array in the script to also have it highlight other drivers; look for this section:

```
    var drivers = [
        ["", ""+custid+"", "#FFF3B3"],
        ["You", "your_custid_here", "#FFF3B3"],
        ["Driver1", "driver1_custid_here", "#FFB1CC"],
        ["Driver2", "driver2_custid_here", "#C1FFAF"],
        ["Driver3", "driver3_custid_here", "#B2ECFF"],
        ["Driver4", "driver4_custid_here", "#CEC1E7"],
        ["Driver5", "driver5_custid_here", "#FFB459"]
    ];
```
